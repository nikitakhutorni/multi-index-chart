This repository contains all assets and code used in my article *[How to make multi-index index charts with Plotly](https://medium.com/data-science/how-to-make-multi-index-index-charts-with-plotly-4d3984cd7b09)* published in the Towards Data Science publication on Medium.

*Note 06/2025: Datapane, which I used to host the live Plotly graphs has since discontinued operation. If you want to see them, you'll have to run the notebook.*
